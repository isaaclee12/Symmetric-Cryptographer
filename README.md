# Symmetric-Cryptographer

A small, personal, for-fun project where I created a program that can ecrypt and decrypt a string symmetrically.
In other words, each character an unencrypted string is mapped to another character in the set of all characters (i.e. the letters, numbers, and symbols on your keyboard)
randomly each time an encryption is performed. Each encryption has a "key" assigned to it that can be used to decrypt the cyphertext.

This was more of a small project so that I could practice some simply cryptography, and also to brush up on my C++ skills. My hope is to be able to learn more
about cryptography and cybersecurity, such that I could confidently implement a (relatively) safe and secure encryption system for on of my
future projects.

This project was created using JetBrains CLion. To run this program you can clone this repo to CLion and run it from there, otherwise you will have to run CMAKE through another means in order to compile and run the binaries.
